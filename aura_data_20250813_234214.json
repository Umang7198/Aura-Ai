The issue of management of stray dogs as well as safety of people is definitely a matter of concern. However, it is not something that can be resolved by arbitrary orders passed by the judiciary without any larger consultative process. Also, subjecting defenseless animals to wanton cruelty can never be a solution. We have sufficient laws in the country to deal with the issue of stray dogs and their sterilization as well as population control. And I agree that it is a very important issue where the welfare and safety of common people is concerned. However, the failure of municipal authorities to implement these laws and do their job cannot and should not become a reason for the judiciary to impose cruel and inhumane directions.",

To Shri Nitin Gadkari Minister of Road Transport and Highways Government of India Transport Bhawan, 1 Parliament Street New Delhi – 110001 Date: 4 August 2025 Subject: Questions Regarding Ethanol Blending and Its Impact on Vehicle Engines Respected Shri Gadkari Ji, I am writing to you as a concerned citizen, and taxpayer, regarding the government's push toward 20% ethanol blending (E20) in petrol across the country. While I appreciate the government's intent to reduce oil imports and promote greener alternatives, I would like to raise a few genuine questions that are being echoed by many Indians: 1. Multiple automobile experts and mechanics have reported that E20 fuel causes faster wear and tear of engines not designed for high ethanol blends. Engine components such as fuel pumps, injectors, and valves are reportedly deteriorating. Has the Ministry conducted any independent and transparent study on the long-term impact of E20 fuel on existing vehicles? 2. Is there a conflict of interest involved? Do you or any of your close family members have any direct or indirect investments, business interests, or associations with ethanol manufacturing or distribution companies? A clarification from your end would help clear public doubts and uphold transparency. 3. Why is the ethanol blending target being accelerated so aggressively when a large part of the Indian vehicle fleet is not compatible with E20 fuel? Why wasn't a phased rollout or vehicle compatibility mandate implemented before full-scale adoption? 4. Have automobile manufacturers been consulted and held accountable for engine failures resulting from ethanol blends in vehicles not designed to handle them? Who will bear the cost of engine damage suffered by unsuspecting vehicle owners? 5. Have the environmental and economic costs of large-scale ethanol production been evaluated? Ethanol production demands enormous quantities of water and often uses food crops like sugarcane, which may lead to food inflation and strain our water resources. What is the government's assessment of these trade-offs? 6. If ethanol is cheaper than petrol, why hasn’t the retail price of blended fuel come down? The public was told ethanol blending would lower fuel prices — yet petrol prices remain the same or have even risen. Where is the cost benefit going? I request you to respond to these concerns with transparency and urgency. These are not just technical issues — they affect the daily lives and wallets of millions of Indians. I look forward to a public and detailed clarification. Yours sincerely, Garvit Sethi A Concerned Citizen",
